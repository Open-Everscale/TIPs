# TON Improvement Proposals (TIPs)

TON Improvement Proposals (TIPs) describe standards for the TON platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.

**Before you initiate a pull request**, please read the TIP-1 process document. Ideas should be thoroughly discussed prior to opening a pull request, such as on the TON Magicians forums or in a GitHub issue in this repository.

This repository tracks the ongoing status of TIPs. It contains:

 - **Draft** proposals which intend to complete the TIP review process.
 - **Last Call** for proposals that may become final
 - **Accepted** proposals which are awaiting implementation or deployment by TON client developers.
 - **Final** and Active proposals that are recorded.
 - The **TIP process** that governs the TIP repository.

Achieving "Final" status in this repository only represents that a proposal has been reviewed for technical accuracy. It is solely the responsibility of the reader to decide whether a proposal will be useful to them.

## Project Goal

The TON Improvement Proposals repository exists as a place to share concrete proposals with potential users of the proposal and the TON community at large.
