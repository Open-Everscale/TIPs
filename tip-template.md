This is the suggested template for new TIPs.

## Simple Summary
If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the TIP. Imagine an email subject line, GitHub PR title, or forum post title.

## Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

## Motivation
The motivation section should describe the "why" of this TIP. What problem does it solve? Why should someone want to implement this standard? What benefit does it provide to the TON ecosystem? What use cases does this TIP address?

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations.

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

## Backwards Compatibility
All TIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The TIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. TIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Test Cases
Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for TIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other TIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.

## Reference Implementation
The reference implementation must be completed before any TIP is given status “Final”, but it need not be completed before the TIP is accepted. It is better to finish the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it before writing code. The final implementation must include test code and documentation appropriate for the TON protocol.
